This is Derick's Resume

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Keep only necessary files

* have a .yarnrc file in root
* contents: registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/  
* instead of yarn install: yarn install --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/ 
* may need to remove node modules if installing again
